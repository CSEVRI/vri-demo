🛡️ CSE Vulnerability Risk Indicator Tool (Standalone Demo)

This repository hosts the offline, standalone Windows version of the CSE Vulnerability Risk Indicator (CSE-VRI).
The tool is designed for use by Designated Safeguarding Leads (DSLs) and authorised safeguarding staff working in schools.
It supports structured CSE risk assessment, record-keeping, and review, with a particular focus on online-to-offline exploitation risk. The app runs entirely locally and does not require internet access, installation, or administrator permissions.

📦 What’s included:

A fully self-contained Windows standalone app
Portable R runtime bundled with the app (no installation required)
Structured CSE risk assessment form with weighted indicators
Safeguarding advice engine linked to selected indicators
Word report and Action Plan generation
Local, cumulative assessment logging
Dashboard showing cohort-level patterns and trends
DSL Quick Start guide and Technical README

🎯 Purpose:

The tool is intended to support frontline safeguarding practice by helping DSLs to:
Identify and record indicators linked to child sexual exploitation, including digital risk
Combine professional judgement with a consistent, structured scoring framework
Review previous assessments for individual pupils using UPN
Build a local picture of emerging patterns across year groups or cohorts
Generate clear documentation to support safeguarding files, supervision, and referrals
The tool is designed as decision support. It does not replace professional judgement, statutory guidance, or local safeguarding procedures.
The indicator structure and guidance are informed by current safeguarding practice and align with Keeping Children Safe in Education (KCSIE), CERAF / SERAF, and contemporary research on digital and contextual exploitation.
